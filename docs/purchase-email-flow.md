# Implementation Notes: Purchase and Email Flow

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the automatic email download links functionality and ensuring purchased samples appear correctly in the user's dashboard.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Email Functionality
- Created `/lib/email.ts` with nodemailer configuration
- Added `sendPurchaseConfirmationEmail` function to send download links
- Set up a template for purchase confirmation emails

### 2. Webhook Handler Enhancements
- Updated the Stripe webhook handler to send emails after successful purchase
- Improved user association with orders in the webhook handler
- Added producer information to email data

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- Enhanced `/api/user/purchases` endpoint to show all purchases (both user ID and email matches)
- Improved error handling in the dashboard page
- Added logging to help with debugging

### 4. Download Functionality
- Updated download token handling to be more robust
- Enhanced error messages for expired or limit-exceeded downloads

## Testing

To test the full flow:
1. Make a purchase as a logged-in user
2. The webhook should associate the purchase with the user and send an email
3. The purchased samples should appear in the dashboard
4. Download links in both the email and dashboard should work

## Configuration

Add the following to your `.env.local` file:
```
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@etherealtechno.com
```

For testing, you can use [Ethereal Email](https://ethereal.email/) which provides free test SMTP accounts.

## Packages Added
